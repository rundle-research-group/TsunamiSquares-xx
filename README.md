C++ tool for modeling tsunamis generated by seafloor displacements using the Tsunami Squares method (Steven N. Ward).  Extended from c++ code written by Kasey W. Schultz and John Max Wilson (<https://github.com/johnmaxwilson/TsunamiSquares>) with intent to model a spherical or ellipsoidal Earth and improve stability.

## Requirements
NOAA ETOPO1 combined bathymetry and topology data not included, can be downloaded from <https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/>  
Generating seafloor uplift initial conditions requires the quakelib library, part of Virtual Quake (<https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/vq/>).

Additionally, the following packages and libraries are required
### C++
OpenMP  
Geographiclib  
boost v1.64  
netCDF  
ALGLIB  

### Python
python 2.7  
numpy  
matplotlib  
Basemap  
ffmpeg  
scipy  
Geographiclib  
netCDF4  

### How to Use
To compile, navigate to the src/ directory and do
`$ make`  
You might have to modify the makefile to match your system.

Run simulation with  
`$ ./TsunamiSquares parameter_file.txt`  
See below for how to contruct a parameter file.

Visualizations, bathymetry subsets, and initial condition displacement fields can be created with tsunami_tools.py.  For usage options, do  
`$ python tsunami_tools.py --help`


## Parameter Definitions  
The parameter text file contains simulation parameters which may be changed without recompiling from source.
